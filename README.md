# PowerShell

Purpose: 
This repository contains a curated set of PowerShell scripts created during my career in Security Engineering. 
These scripts focus on automating routine security tasks, simplifying system administration, strengthening endpoint visibility, and supporting incident response workflows. 
The goal of this repository is to provide reusable, adaptable tools that reflect practical, hands-on experience in securing Windows environments and improving operational efficiency.

**NOTE** A lot of these scripts were created around the time I was conducting application recertification across multiple Organizations so automating information gathering was incredibly useful at the time.
